"""The one thing the phone cannot do for itself: notice that it has gone quiet.

Everything else in this product assumes the app is running while the person uses the phone. A phone
that is switched off, out of battery, or whose app has been killed cannot report any of that — so
"no heartbeat" has to be noticed *here*, and the answer is a person, not another feature.
